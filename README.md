# Jordan's front end web developer hiring exercise
- Started from scratch, using Bootstrap 4 to help me out with formatting
- Focused on creating the page top-down, first the general template, then went to fill in details
- With another hour, I would stylize the page further to get it closer to the comp
- Would also make it more mobile-friendly, as my call to action and recent news components didn't scale as planned!
